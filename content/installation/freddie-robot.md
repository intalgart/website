A relatively straightforward gif created using Processing. Each individual dot oscillates sinusoidally along a fixed radial path. Adjacent dots have different oscillation frequencies, which results in interesting patterns.

This follows the mathematics of the [pendulum wave][pendulum_wave] phenomenon, which is explained very well in this paper. The difference here is that the pendula have been arranged in a circle, rather than a straight line. As a bonus, staring at the centre of the image induces an illusion effect, where some of the dots appear to have dark centres.
