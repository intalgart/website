Soundcastle was exhibited at the Ottawa Maker Faire. Maker Faire is an all-ages gathering of tech enthusiasts, crafters, educators, tinkerers, hobbyists, engineers, science clubs, authors, artists, students, and commercial exhibitors. All of these “makers” come to Maker Faire to show what they have made and to share what they have learned.

For one spectacular weekend, Aberdeen Pavilion in Ottawa’s historic fairgrounds will be transformed into a model Maker City, a showcase of human ingenuity and imagination to entertain, inform and inspire. This first global Maker Faire Ottawa will take its cue from the new ideas and new technologies that are now emerging from the creative centers around the world. It will be a prototype for a community of tomorrow, always unfinished, always introducing, and testing, and demonstrating new materials and new systems.
