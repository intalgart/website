A cube was constructed with regular mirrors forming three adjacent faces, while the opposite faces were 50/50 mirrors.

Blue electro-luminescent wire was placed inside as an illumination source. The result is a mesmerizing kaleidoscopic infinity mirror effect. Since the faces are made from acrylic, pressing on them only makes the effect better.
