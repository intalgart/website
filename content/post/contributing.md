Our new sie has been updated and with it a improved workflow for collaboration. This site is powered by [Hugo][hugo] (a static site generator) that converts markdown files to html and allows for a quick and easy deployment to GitHub pages.

This allows for many potential contributors to simply perform a pull request and submit a markdown file alongside with the appropriate front matter (metadata about the content).

Should the pull request be accepted the code will automatically be pushed to the live website via [Travis CI][travis-ci] and published to [intalgart.github.io][intalgart].

For more information on how to contribute to the documentation site please consult the [README.md][readme] file.
